# Meesum Ashary's Personal Portfolio Project

Welcome all to my personal portfolio project!

Here is a glimps of what my portfolio currently looks like:

![](/assets/Portfolio%20pics/Interests-section.png)
![](/assets/Portfolio%20pics/contact-section.png)

Some key take aways from it is that there is a fixed nav bar that stays on the left side of the screen at all times. when links on the nav bar are clicked it scrolls directly to that section. In the Interest page each poem is interactive. Once clicked it maximizes on the screen and can be read easier.

# Technologies Used

The technologies used to create this portfolios were mainly, HTML, JavaScript and CSS. I have deployed my project on Netlify.

# Installation Instruction

The project file consits of an index.html which is the main HTML file. There is a JS folder that has a javascript file. There is also a stlyes folder that has one main css and reset css.There is a planning folder that contains wire frames and user stories. In the assets folder there are all the imgages i have used throughout the portfolio.

# Unsolved Problems.

The hardest portion of this portfolio was making the UI responsive. Luckily everything is functional and looks some looks like it was intended too. The only unsolved problem is that I did not reach any stretch Goals. So It will still be a work in progress.
